## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I studied at Univeristy of Verona, obtaining first a Bachelor's Degree in Bioinformatics, and then a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, curriculum Visual Computing. In 2021 I started PhD in Computer Science at the University of Verona.

## Research Interest

My main research interests are Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning applied to CV. In particular, I am interested in people analysis, oriented to crowded and complex real-world environments. I have a lot of experience in handling real-world scenarios of video surveillance and applying deep learning techniques like for instance people detection, people tracking, gathering detection, etc.
My thesis will focus on industrial scene analysis from heterogeneous sensors, with particular attention to human attention estimation in industrial environments.
