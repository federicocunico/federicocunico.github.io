I studied at Univeristy of Verona, obtaining first a Bachelor’s Degree in Bioinformatics, and then a Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, curriculum Visual Computing. In 2021 I started PhD in Computer Science at the University of Verona, and I am going to defend my thesis in early 2025.
My main research interests are Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning applied to CV. In particular, I am interested in people analysis, oriented to crowded and complex real-world environments. I have a lot of experience in handling real-world scenarios of video surveillance and applying deep learning techniques like for instance people detection, people tracking, gathering detection, etc. My thesis will focus on industrial scene analysis from heterogeneous sensors, with particular attention to human attention estimation in industrial environments.
Since October 2024, I am working in the ALTAIR laboratory of the University of Verona, applying Computer Vision to the Medical Domain for robotic assisted surgery (RAS).
