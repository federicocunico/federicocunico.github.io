I studied at Univeristy of Verona, obtaining first a Bachelor’s Degree in Bioinformatics, and then a Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, curriculum Visual Computing. In 2021 I started PhD in Computer Science at the University of Verona, and I am going to defend my thesis in early 2025. My thesis will focus on human-centered scene analysis in industrial environments, investigating human-robot interaction from different perspectives.
Since October 2024, I am working in the ALTAIR laboratory of the University of Verona, applying computer vision to robotic assisted surgery.
